    "# Question 2: Logistic Regression (15 pts) \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression has been traditionally used to classify data when a **linear decision boundary** is adequate. However, having an idea of what the distribution looks like could help one come up with a smart data transformation trick that could make the optimal decision boundary become (near) linear in the transformed space. In this question, you are given 2-dimensional data, and each data point belongs to either class 0 or class 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "a) **(5 pts)** Train a logistic regression classifier using X_train, y_train. Use the trained model to make predictions on X_train, X_test respectively, and then report the accuracies and F1-scores. Sklearn has a very nice [utility](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) that helps compute the precision, recall, accuracy and F1-scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) **(5 pts)** Plot the X_train data using matplotlib, use different colors to represent different classes. Comment on the pattern of data distributions, and reason why the logistic regression classifier in (a) does not perform very well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "c) **(5 pts)** Transform the input X_train and X_test data in such a way that a linear decision boundary will be effective. Train a new logistic regression classifier on this transformed X_train data. Use the trained model to make predictions on transformed X_train, transformed X_test respectively, and then report the accuracies and F1-scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Carefully analyze the plot you made in (b), observe the decision boundaries, which should guide you towards the right direction."
